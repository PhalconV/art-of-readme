# Maternal Mortality Analysis Project

## Overview

This project analyzes maternal mortality data to uncover key factors contributing to maternal deaths, assess regional and demographic trends, and provide data-driven insights for improving maternal health outcomes. The analysis aims to support policymakers, researchers, and healthcare professionals in developing targeted interventions to reduce maternal deaths.

## Objectives

- Identify major causes and risk factors associated with maternal mortality.
- Examine trends over time and geographical distribution of cases.
- Explore relationships between socioeconomic, demographic, and healthcare access variables.
- Recommend policy and healthcare strategies to reduce maternal deaths.
